# Absent Flow

## What is Absent Flow?

An overflow/queue flow used when your inbox is too busy or agents are unavailable, guiding contacts while they wait.

## When does it trigger?

* When the channel hits an absent/overflow condition (e.g., queue full, offline window) and an Absent Flow is configured.

## What happens after it triggers?

Contacts get the absent message and can be routed to the options/flows you provide, keeping them engaged while your team is unavailable.

## Important behavior to know

* Runs only under absent/overflow conditions.
* Options should map to valid flows so contacts aren’t stuck.

## Common issues & solutions

* Not firing: check the overflow/absent condition and that the flow is assigned.
* Options not working: verify each option points to a live flow.

## Best practice 💡

* Offer 2–4 clear options; avoid long menus.
* Include expected response time or follow-up promise to set expectations.
