# Growth Tools

## What is Growth Tools?

Growth Tools provide shareable links and QR codes that start conversations. They connect people from web pages or offline scans into a Message Flow and track impressions, opt-ins, and conversion.

## When does it trigger?

* When someone clicks the Growth Tool link or scans its QR code.
* When the linked Message Flow is available and the channel is connected.

## What happens after it triggers?

The contact is sent into the linked Message Flow, receives the configured replies, and their interaction counts toward impressions/opt-ins/conversion metrics.

## Important behavior to know

* A Growth Tool must have a linked flow; if none is set, visitors will not receive an automated reply.
* Stats (impressions, opt-ins, conversion) help you gauge performance; changes may take a short time to reflect.
* Export is available for backing up Growth Tool data.

## Common issues & solutions

* No reply: verify the link/QR is correct, the flow is active, and the channel is connected.
* Wrong flow: update the Growth Tool to point to the intended flow and retest.
* Low conversion: place the link/QR in a more visible spot and keep the first message concise.

## Best practice 💡

* Use clear placement and labeling for links/QRs so people know what happens when they click or scan.
* Pair each Growth Tool with a short, goal-focused flow.
* Review conversion stats regularly and adjust the opening message or placement to improve opt-ins.
