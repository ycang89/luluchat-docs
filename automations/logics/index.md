# Automation Logics

## Overview
Logics are non-messaging nodes that control the flow, timing, and data management of your automations. They allow you to create sophisticated customer journeys by branching paths, delaying actions, or performing background updates.

## Logic Nodes
- [Actions](./actions.md): Perform background tasks like tagging or assigning.
- [Round Robin](./round-robin.md): Distribute traffic or tasks equally among team members.
- [Smart Delay](./smart-delay.md): Pause the flow for a specific time or until a specific event.
- [Condition](./condition.md): Create branching paths based on specific criteria or contact data.
- [Randomizer](./randomizer.md): Split traffic for A/B testing or random distribution.
