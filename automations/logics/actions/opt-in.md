**Important behavior to know**

- **Consent Required**: Contacts must have previously opted out before they can opt back in. You cannot opt in contacts who have never opted out.
- **User Consent**: Use only when you have clear user consent. This action helps you comply with WhatsApp's messaging policies.
- **Broadcast Eligibility**: Once a contact opts in, they become eligible to receive broadcasts again (assuming they meet other criteria like being imported to Contacts).
- **Opt-in Status**: Opt-in status affects future messaging eligibility for broadcasts and automated flows.
{% endhint %}

## Common issues & solutions
- Status not updated: ensure the action is on the published path and the channel is connected.

## Best practice 💡
- Keep a clear consent prompt before this action.
- Tag or note the source of consent for compliance.
