# Summary

## What is Deals Summary?

The Summary page provides a consolidated view of your sales activities. It helps managers and sales teams track their goals, monitor the health of the pipeline, and identify which deals require immediate attention.

## When does it trigger?

This is a reporting view that is always available. It updates dynamically as your sales team adds deals, updates their value, or moves them through the sales funnel.

## How to set it up (Step by Step)

## What happens after it triggers?

The dashboard will populate with your sales metrics, including total deal value, status breakdown (Won/Lost/Open), and your conversion funnel.

## Important behavior to know

* **Real-time Revenue**: The total deal value updates instantly when you change an amount on a deal card.
* **Funnel Calculation**: The "Funnel" view shows how many leads move from the first stage to the final "Won" stage.
* **Permissions**: Some users may only see deal data for themselves or their team, depending on their access role.

## Common issues & solutions

* **Zero value showing**: Ensure every deal card in the board has an "Amount" entered. If the amount is blank, it won't be counted in the summary.
* **Missing deals**: Check if your "Date Range" is too narrow or if you've accidentally filtered for a different owner.

## Best practice 💡

* **Track Deal Value**: Ensure every deal has an estimated value so the Summary page can accurately reflect your potential revenue.
* **Identify Bottlenecks**: If one stage has significantly more deals than others, it may indicate a need for more resources or a change in the sales process at that stage.
