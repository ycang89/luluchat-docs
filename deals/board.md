# Deals: Board

## What is the Deals Board?
The Board is your primary workspace for managing sales. It uses a Kanban layout to visualize your sales funnel, making it easy to see which stage each deal is in and what needs to happen next.

## Managing the Sales Board

### Visualizing Revenue
One of the key features of the Deals Board is the **Amount Display**:
- Each card shows the deal's monetary value.
- Each stage header displays the **Total Amount** of all deals within that column.

### Moving Deals
- **Progressing a Deal**: Drag a card from left to right as the lead moves closer to a sale.
- **Winning or Losing**: Move a deal to a designated "Won" or "Lost" stage to update its status and your sales reports.

### Board Actions
- **Create Deal**: Click the **+ (Plus)** icon in any stage column.
- **Settings**: Use the **Settings (gear)** icon on the right to edit the Pipeline name or manage your stages.

## Filtering the Board
- **Deal Number**: Search for a specific deal by its unique ID.
- **Deal Owner**: Filter the board to see only deals assigned to a specific salesperson.
- **Advanced Filters**: Filter by **Tags**, **Amount Range**, **Priority**, and **Dates**.

## The Deal Form
Opening a deal allows you to update:
- **Deal Title & Company**: Who the deal is with.
- **Amount**: The expected revenue from this sale.
- **Deal Owner**: The primary contact on your team for this deal.
- **Tags & Priority**: Organizational and urgency markers.
- **Custom Attributes**: Capture specific data unique to your sales process.

## Important behavior to know
- **Contact Sync**: Deals are linked to contact profiles. You can create a deal for a contact directly from the **Contact Info** panel in the `Inbox`.
- **Automatic Calculations**: The board totals update in real-time as you move deals or update their amounts.

## Best practice 💡
- **Clean Pipelines**: Archive old or stale deals regularly to keep the board focused on active opportunities.
- **Collaborator Notes**: Use the notes/comments within the Deal Form to keep the team updated on the latest sales discussions.
