# Deals: List

## What is the Deals List?
The List view is a spreadsheet-style interface for your deals. It allows you to see all deal data in a single table, making it the best view for sorting, bulk editing, and detailed searching.

## Using the List View

### Searching and Filtering
- **Quick Search**: Search by deal name, number, or company.
- **Sorting**: Sort by **Amount** to see your highest-value opportunities at the top, or by **Last Updated** to see the most recent activity.
- **Filters**: Apply the same robust filters found on the board to narrow down the list.

### Viewing Deal Data
Each row represents a deal and displays its most important fields, such as:
- **Deal Number**
- **Company**
- **Stage**
- **Deal Owner**
- **Amount**
- **Last Updated**

## When to use List vs Board?
- **Use Board** for day-to-day management and moving deals through the funnel.
- **Use List** for a more granular look at your data, such as when you need to see a list of all deals over a certain amount or those assigned to a specific rep.
