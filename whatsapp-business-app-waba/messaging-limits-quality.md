# Messaging Limits, Tiers & Quality Rating

## What are Messaging Limits?

Messaging limits control how many messages you can send through WhatsApp Business App (WABA). These limits are based on your account tier and help prevent spam while ensuring message quality across the platform.

## Account Tiers

WhatsApp uses a tiered system to determine your messaging limits. Your tier is based on your account's messaging history, quality, and verification status.

## Understanding Quality Rating

WhatsApp assigns a **Quality Rating** to your business account based on how customers interact with your messages. This rating directly affects your messaging limits and account standing.

### Quality Rating Levels

| Rating | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **High (Green)** | Excellent customer engagement | Full messaging limits, potential tier upgrades |
| **Medium (Yellow)** | Good engagement with room for improvement | Normal limits, monitor for improvements |
| **Low (Red)** | Poor engagement or policy issues | Reduced limits, account restrictions possible |

### Factors That Affect Quality Rating

**Positive Factors** (Improve Rating):
- **High Read Rates**: Customers open and read your messages
- **Positive Responses**: Customers reply to your messages
- **Low Block Rates**: Few customers block your number
- **Relevant Content**: Messages are relevant and valuable to recipients
- **Opt-In Compliance**: Only messaging customers who opted in
- **Template Quality**: Using appropriate template categories

**Negative Factors** (Lower Rating):
- **Low Read Rates**: Many messages go unread
- **High Block Rates**: Many customers block your number
- **Spam Reports**: Customers report your messages as spam
- **Policy Violations**: Violating WhatsApp Business policies
- **Irrelevant Content**: Sending messages customers don't want
- **Template Misuse**: Using wrong template categories

## How Limits Work

### Conversation Limits

- **Per Month**: Limits are based on unique conversations per month
- **Resets Monthly**: Limits reset at the beginning of each month
- **Per Conversation**: Multiple messages within the same 24-hour conversation count as one conversation
- **User-Initiated**: Free user-initiated conversations don't count toward tier limits

### Rate Limits

In addition to monthly limits, there are also **rate limits** (messages per second):

- **Tier 1**: Lower rate limits
- **Tier 2-3**: Higher rate limits
- **Tier 4**: Custom rate limits

Rate limits prevent sending too many messages too quickly, which helps maintain platform stability.

## Important behavior to know

- **Quality Over Quantity**: Maintaining high quality is more important than sending many messages
- **Tier Progression**: Tiers are not automatic - you must demonstrate quality to advance
- **Tier Reduction**: Poor quality can result in tier reduction or limit restrictions
- **Verification Impact**: Verified businesses (blue tick) often have higher limits and faster tier progression
- **Regional Variations**: Limits and tiers may vary by country or region
- **Policy Compliance**: Violating policies can result in immediate limit reductions or account restrictions

## Monitoring Your Status

### Where to Check

- **Meta Business Manager**: View your current tier and limits
- **Quality Rating**: Check your quality score in your WABA dashboard
- **Message Status**: Monitor read rates, reply rates, and block rates
- **Template Status**: Review template approval rates and quality scores

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- **Read Rate**: Percentage of messages that are read
- **Reply Rate**: Percentage of messages that receive replies
- **Block Rate**: Percentage of customers who block your number
- **Spam Reports**: Number of spam reports received
- **Template Approval Rate**: Percentage of templates approved

## Common issues & solutions

- **Low Quality Rating**:
  - Review your messaging content for relevance
  - Ensure you're only messaging opted-in customers
  - Improve message personalization
  - Use appropriate template categories
  - Reduce messaging frequency if customers aren't engaging

- **Hit Messaging Limits**:
  - Wait for monthly limit reset
  - Focus on quality over quantity
  - Use user-initiated conversations (free, don't count toward limits)
  - Request tier upgrade if you consistently need more capacity

- **Tier Not Increasing**:
  - Maintain high quality scores consistently
  - Avoid any policy violations
  - Build positive messaging history over time
  - Consider business verification for faster progression

- **Rate Limit Exceeded**:

  - Use message queues to manage sending rate
  - Upgrade tier for higher rate limits

## Best practice 💡

- **Prioritize Quality**: Always focus on sending relevant, valuable messages over high volume
- **Monitor Metrics**: Regularly check your quality rating and engagement metrics
- **Respect Opt-Outs**: Immediately honor opt-out requests to maintain quality
- **Use Right Templates**: Choose appropriate template categories (Utility/Service over Marketing when possible)
- **Personalize Messages**: Use variables to personalize messages and improve engagement
- **Test Before Scaling**: Test messaging strategies on small groups before sending to large audiences
- **Maintain Compliance**: Always follow WhatsApp Business policies to avoid restrictions
- **Build Gradually**: Start with lower volumes and increase as you build positive history

## Improving Your Quality Rating
