# Service Window (24-Hour Messaging Window)

## What is the Service Window?

The 24-hour service window is a fundamental rule in WhatsApp Business messaging. After a customer sends you a message, you have **24 hours** to respond with a free, conversational message.

## How it works

- **Within 24 hours**: You can send unlimited free messages to the customer without using a message template.
- **After 24 hours**: You can only contact the customer using an approved **Message Template** (which may incur charges).

## Why it matters

- **Cost Control**: Free messages within the window help reduce messaging costs.
- **Customer Engagement**: Responding quickly keeps conversations active and free.
- **Template Requirement**: After 24 hours, you must use templates, which require approval and may have associated costs.

**Best Practice**: Always respond to customer messages within 24 hours to maintain free messaging. Set up automated responses or assign team members to ensure timely replies.
{% endhint %}

## Example Scenario

1. Customer sends "Hello" at 10:00 AM on Monday
2. You can send free messages until 10:00 AM on Tuesday
3. After 10:00 AM Tuesday, you must use a Message Template to contact them

## Important behavior to know

- **Timer Starts**: The 24-hour window starts from the moment the customer sends their last message, not from when you read it.
- **Resets on Reply**: If the customer replies again within the window, the timer resets for another 24 hours.
- **Template Required**: Once the window expires, you cannot send free messages. You must use an approved Message Template.
- **Multiple Conversations**: Each conversation with a customer has its own independent 24-hour window.

## Common issues & solutions

- **Window Expired**: If you missed the 24-hour window, use an appropriate Message Template to continue the conversation. See [Message Template Types](./message-template-types.md) for guidance.
- **Not Responding in Time**: Set up automated responses, assign team members, or use Message Flows to ensure timely replies.
- **Unclear When Window Expires**: Check the conversation timestamp in your inbox. The window expires 24 hours after the customer's last message.

## Best practice 💡

- **Set Reminders**: Use Luluchat's "Remind Me" feature to get notified before the window expires.
- **Automate Responses**: Set up Message Flows to automatically respond to common inquiries within the window.
- **Monitor Conversations**: Regularly check your inbox for conversations approaching the 24-hour limit.
- **Use Templates Wisely**: When the window expires, choose the appropriate template category (Utility or Service) for faster approval and lower costs.
