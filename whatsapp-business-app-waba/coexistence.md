# Coexistence

## What is Coexistence?

Coexistence refers to the ability to have both **WhatsApp Personal** and **WhatsApp Business App (WABA)** accounts connected to the same phone number or business. This allows you to use both account types simultaneously, each with their own features and capabilities.

## How it works

- **Same Phone Number**: In some cases, you can use the same phone number for both personal and business messaging, but they operate independently.
- **Different Features**: Each account type has different capabilities and limitations.
- **Separate Management**: You manage them separately in Luluchat and they appear as different channels.
- **Independent Conversations**: Messages and conversations are kept separate between Personal and WABA accounts.

## Account Type Comparison

| Feature | WhatsApp Personal | WhatsApp Business App (WABA) |
|---------|------------------|------------------------------|
| **Message Templates** | Not available | Required for outbound after 24h |
| **Verified Status** | Not available | Available with business verification |
| **Analytics** | Basic | Advanced analytics and insights |
| **API Access** | Limited | Full API access |
| **Business Features** | Basic | Enterprise-grade features |
| **Best For** | Small businesses, testing | Growing businesses, enterprises |

## Important Considerations

### When Coexistence is Possible

- **Different Phone Numbers**: You can always have both account types if they use different phone numbers.
- **Same Number (Limited)**: In some cases, Meta allows the same number for both, but this depends on:
  - Your account setup
  - Meta's current policies
  - Your business verification status
  - Regional regulations

### When to Use Each Type

**Use WhatsApp Personal when**:
- You're a small business or individual
- You're testing Luluchat features
- You don't need message templates
- You want a simple setup
- You have low message volume

**Use WABA when**:
- You need to send message templates
- You want verified business status (blue tick)
- You need advanced analytics
- You're sending high message volumes
- You need enterprise features
- You want to use Broadcasts at scale

### Migration Considerations

- **Growing Business**: As your business grows, you may need to migrate from Personal to WABA.
- **Feature Needs**: If you need templates or verified status, WABA is required.
- **Separate Setup**: Each account type requires separate setup and connection in Luluchat.
- **Data Transfer**: Conversation history and contacts are separate between account types.

**Note**: Coexistence rules and availability can change. Always check with Meta's current policies and your WABA account status. Not all phone numbers or regions support coexistence with the same number.

## Important behavior to know

- **Independent Operation**: Personal and WABA accounts work independently. Messages sent from one don't appear in the other.
- **Separate Channels**: In Luluchat, each account type appears as a separate channel that you can switch between.
- **Different Limits**: Each account type has different messaging limits and capabilities.
- **Policy Differences**: WABA has stricter policies and requirements than Personal accounts.

## Common issues & solutions

- **Can't Use Same Number**: Coexistence with the same number isn't always available. Use different phone numbers if you need both account types.
- **Confusion Between Accounts**: Make sure you're sending messages from the correct channel in Luluchat. Check which channel is active before sending.
- **Missing Features**: Remember that Personal accounts don't support templates or verified status. You need WABA for these features.
- **Migration Questions**: If you're migrating from Personal to WABA, you'll need to set up WABA separately. Your Personal account data won't automatically transfer.

## Best practice 💡

- **Start with Personal**: If you're new to Luluchat, start with WhatsApp Personal to test features and understand the platform.
- **Upgrade When Needed**: Migrate to WABA when you need templates, verified status, or enterprise features.
- **Use Different Numbers**: If you need both account types, use different phone numbers to avoid complications.
- **Understand Limitations**: Be aware of what each account type can and cannot do before choosing.
- **Plan for Growth**: Consider your future needs when choosing between Personal and WABA.
