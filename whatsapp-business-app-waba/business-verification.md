- **Takes Time**: The process typically takes 2-4 weeks, sometimes longer
- **Can Be Rejected**: Not all businesses will be approved
- **Ongoing Requirement**: You must maintain compliance to keep verified status
- **Tier Not Automatic**: Verification helps with tiers but doesn't guarantee upgrades

## Common issues & solutions

- **Application Rejected**:
  - Review rejection reason in Meta Business Manager
  - Ensure all documents match your business information exactly
  - Check for any policy violations on your account
