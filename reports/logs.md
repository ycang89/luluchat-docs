Choose a date range using the preset options (Last 7 days, Last 30 days, This month, This year) or select a custom range using the date picker.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Review Message Performance

The "Message Performance" card shows:

* Total Messages Sent: Total number of messages sent from your company during the selected period.
* Total Messages Received: Total number of messages received by your company during the selected period.
* Message Trend Chart: A line chart showing daily message volume (sent and received) over the selected period.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Review New Contact Growth

The "New Contact Growth" card shows:

* Newly Added Contact: Total number of new contacts added during the selected period.
* Growth Trend Chart: A line chart showing daily new contact additions over the selected period.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Analyze Contact Activity Heatmap

The "New Contact Time Analysis" heatmap shows when new contacts are added throughout the week:

* Days of Week: Rows represent days (Monday through Sunday).
* Hours of Day: Columns represent hours (00:00 through 23:00).
* Color Intensity: Darker colors indicate more new contacts added during that time slot.

This helps you identify peak times when new contacts are joining your system.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## What happens after you use it?

* **Charts Displayed**: Message and contact growth charts update to show data for the selected period.
* **Statistics Updated**: Total counts reflect activity within your selected date range.
* **Heatmap Populated**: The heatmap visualizes new contact activity patterns.

## Important behavior to know

* **Date Range Impact**: All statistics and charts reflect only activity within your selected date range.
* **Daily vs Monthly Format**: Charts automatically adjust their time format based on your date range selection (daily for shorter ranges, monthly for year-long ranges).
* **Heatmap Data**: The heatmap only shows data when new contacts were actually added. If no contacts were added in a time slot, that cell appears white.
* **Message Counts**: "Messages Sent" includes all outbound messages (manual, automated, broadcasts). "Messages Received" includes all inbound customer messages.

## Common issues & solutions

* **No data showing**:
  * Check that your date range includes periods when messages were sent/received or contacts were added.
  * Verify that your account has activity in the selected period.
* **Charts are empty**:
  * Ensure your date range includes actual activity.
  * Try expanding your date range to include more historical data.
* **Heatmap is blank**:
  * This means no new contacts were added during the selected period.
  * Try expanding your date range or checking a different time period.
* **Numbers seem incorrect**:
  * All counts are based on your selected date range. Make sure you're looking at the right period.
  * Message counts include all message types (manual, automated, broadcasts).

## Best practice 💡

* **Regular Monitoring**: Check this report weekly to track overall account activity and growth.
* **Identify Patterns**: Use the heatmap to identify peak times for new contact acquisition, which can inform your marketing and support scheduling.
* **Compare Periods**: Export data or take screenshots to compare activity across different time periods.
* **Growth Tracking**: Monitor the "New Contact Growth" chart to track the effectiveness of marketing campaigns or lead generation efforts.
* **Message Volume Analysis**: Use message volume trends to plan resource allocation and identify busy periods.
