# Tickets Summary

## What is Tickets Summary?
The Summary page provides a high-level overview of your ticketing performance. It uses visual reports to help you identify bottlenecks, understand workload distribution, and track ticket volume over time.

## When does it trigger?
This is a reporting view that is always available. It updates automatically as your team creates, moves, or closes tickets within any pipeline.

## How to set it up (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Open Tickets Summary
Click `Tickets` in the left menu, then select the `Summary` tab at the top.

## What happens after it triggers?
The data updates in real-time. Any changes made to tickets on the Board or List view will be reflected here, allowing you to see the immediate impact of your team's work.

## Important behavior to know
- **Date Range Matters**: Most metrics are tied to the selected period. Ensure you've set the correct range to see accurate volume trends.
- **Pipeline Specific**: Reports are generated per pipeline. To see a global view, you must toggle through each pipeline individually.
- **Collaborator Filters**: Filtering by a collaborator only shows tickets where that person is either the primary assignee or a linked teammate.

## Common issues & solutions
- **No data showing**: Confirm that you have selected a pipeline and that there are tickets created within the selected date range.
- **Data seems outdated**: Refresh the page to ensure the latest ticket updates are pulled from the system.

## Best practice 💡
- **Weekly Review**: Use the Summary page once a week to review team performance and ensure no stage is becoming a bottleneck.
- **Identify Trends**: Look at the "Categories of Work" to see if a specific type of issue is spiking, which might indicate a larger system problem.
