# Tickets: Board

## What is the Tickets Board?
The Board is a visual Kanban interface where you manage your day-to-day ticketing operations. Each ticket is represented as a card, and you can move them between columns (stages) as they progress.

## Managing the Board

### Creating a Pipeline
If you haven't created a pipeline yet, you will be prompted to create one.
1. Click **Create Ticketing Pipeline**.
2. Give your pipeline a title and define your initial stages.

### Working with Stages
- **Add Stage**: Scroll to the right of the board and click **Add Stage**.
- **Edit Stage**: Click the **Settings (gear)** icon on a stage header to rename or archive it.
- **Rearrange**: Drag and drop stage headers to change their order.

### Managing Ticket Cards
- **Create Ticket**: Click the **+ (Plus)** icon at the top of any stage column.
- **Move Ticket**: Click and hold a card, then drag it to a new stage.
- **View/Edit Ticket**: Click on a card to open the ticket details form.

## Filtering the Board
Use the top bar to filter which cards are visible:
- **Search Summary**: Search for tickets by their title or description.
- **Collaborators**: Filter by specific team members or "Unassigned".
- **Advanced Filters**: Click **Filters** to access deeper filtering by **Tags**, **Due Date**, **Ticket Number**, **Priority**, and **Creation/Update Dates**.

## The Ticket Form
When you open a ticket, you can manage:
- **Summary & Description**: The main details of the request.
- **Assignee & Collaborators**: Who is responsible for the ticket.
- **Tags**: Categories for easier searching.
- **Priority**: Mark the urgency of the task.
- **Due Date**: Set a deadline for resolution.
- **Activity Logs & Comments**: Track the history of changes and communicate internally.

## Important behavior to know
- **Archiving**: You can archive tickets or entire stages to keep your board tidy without losing data.
- **Sync with Inbox**: You can create and view tickets directly from the **Contact Info** panel in the `Inbox`.

## Best practice 💡
- **Keep it Updated**: Move tickets to the next stage as soon as the work is done to maintain an accurate view of the pipeline.
- **Use Priority**: Always set a priority for new tickets so the team knows what to tackle first.
