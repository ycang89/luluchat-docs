# Tickets: List

## What is the Tickets List?
The List view provides a tabular representation of all tickets within a selected pipeline. It is ideal for bulk reviews, detailed searching, and sorting tickets by specific fields like Ticket Number or Last Updated.

## Using the List View

### Searching and Filtering
The List view includes powerful search capabilities:
- **Search by Number**: Enter the full ticket number (e.g., #1001) to find a specific card instantly.
- **Filter by Status/Stage**: See all tickets in a specific part of the workflow.
- **Sortable Columns**: Click on column headers like **Priority** or **Last Updated** to sort the list.

### Viewing Ticket Details
Clicking on any row in the list will open the **Ticket Form**, allowing you to view the full history, comments, and attachments.

## When to use List vs Board?
- **Use Board** for visual tracking and dragging tickets through a process.
- **Use List** when you need to find a specific ticket number or perform a bulk review of ticket data.
