# Switch Team and Channel

## What is Team and Channel Switching?
Team and Channel switching allows you to move between different teams and WhatsApp channels (phone numbers) from the header bar. This is useful when you're part of multiple teams or manage multiple WhatsApp business numbers.

## When to use it?
- **Multiple Teams**: If you're a member of multiple teams, switch between them to access different workspaces.
- **Multiple Channels**: If your team has multiple WhatsApp channels (phone numbers), switch between them to manage different business profiles or locations.
- **Different Workspaces**: Access different team settings, contacts, and conversations by switching teams.
- **Business Separation**: Manage separate WhatsApp numbers for different business units or brands.

The modal displays all channels (WhatsApp phone numbers) available in your current team. Each channel shows:
- **Channel Name/Phone Number**: The display name or phone number
- **Status**: Whether the channel is connected (ready) or needs setup
- **Switch Button**: Button to switch to that channel (or "Current Selected" if it's already active)

## What happens after you switch?
- **Team Switch**:
  - All data (contacts, conversations, settings) changes to the selected team's data.
  - The page reloads to ensure all data is refreshed.
  - You'll see the team's name and channels in the header.

- **Channel Switch**:
  - You're redirected to Dashboard or Inbox (depending on channel status).
  - The header shows the new channel's phone number.
  - All conversations and contacts are filtered to the selected channel.
  - If switching to an unconnected channel, you'll see the channel setup page.

**Important behavior to know**

- **Team Switch Reload**: Switching teams always reloads the page to ensure all data is refreshed for the new team.
- **Channel Status**: You can switch to channels even if they're not connected, but you'll need to complete the connection setup before using them.
- **Current Selection**: The current team and channel are always indicated with a selected radio button or "Current Selected" label.
- **Data Isolation**: Each team has its own contacts, conversations, settings, and channels. Data does not carry over between teams.
- **Single Team**: If you only belong to one team, the dropdown will show "Current Team" instead of "Switch Teams".
- **Channel Connection Required**: To use a channel for messaging, it must be connected (status: "ready"). Unconnected channels will show "Connect Now" instead of "Switch".
{% endhint %}

## Common issues & solutions
- **Can't see other teams**:
  - You may only be a member of one team. Contact your team admin to be added to additional teams.
  - Check that you have the correct permissions to access multiple teams.

- **Team switch not working**:
  - Wait for the page reload to complete. Team switching requires a full page refresh.
  - If it still doesn't work, try refreshing the page manually or logging out and back in.

- **Channel not appearing**:
  - Ensure you're in the correct team (channels are team-specific).
  - Check that the channel exists and you have permission to access it.
  - Try refreshing the page.

- **Can't switch to unconnected channel**:
  - You can switch to unconnected channels, but you'll need to complete the connection setup first.
  - Click "Connect Now" or go to Inbox to set up the channel connection.

- **Wrong channel showing**:
  - Verify you've successfully switched by checking the phone number in the Channels button.
  - If the wrong channel is still showing, try switching again or refreshing the page.

## Best practice 💡
- **Use Clear Channel Names**: Give your channels descriptive names (e.g., "Main Business", "Support Line") to easily identify them when switching.
- **Verify After Switching**: Always check the header bar to confirm you're in the correct team and channel.
- **Team Organization**: Use separate teams for completely different businesses or organizations to keep data isolated.
- **Channel Organization**: Use multiple channels within the same team for different departments, locations, or business units.
- **Before Switching**: Save any unsaved work before switching teams, as the page will reload.
