# Contacts

## What is the Contacts Module?
The Contacts module is your central audience hub. It is where you store, segment, and manage everyone who has ever interacted with your business on WhatsApp. Think of it as your WhatsApp-specific CRM.

## Audience Overview
In the **Contacts List**, you can see:
- **Identity**: Contact name, avatar, and WhatsApp number.
- **Segmentation**: Tags and Lists (Inbox Tabs) applied to each person.
- **Ownership**: The team member (Assignee) responsible for the relationship.
- **Engagement**: Total messages sent and received.
- **Consent**: Opt-in/Opt-out status for marketing messages.

## Managing Individual Contacts
Click on any contact's name to open their **Details Form**. From here you can:
- Update their **Display Name** or **Remarks**.
- Manage their **Tags** and **Assignee**.
- View and edit **Custom Attributes** (e.g., Company, Email, Birthday).
- Toggle their **Opt-In** status.
