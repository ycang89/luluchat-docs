# Contacts: Bulk Updates & Advanced Actions

## Managing at Scale
Managing hundreds or thousands of contacts manually is impossible. Luluchat provides bulk tools to help you segment and update your audience quickly.

### Bulk Update
Select multiple contacts using the checkboxes on the left, then click **Bulk Update** in the bottom toolbar:
- **Add/Remove Tags**: Categorize a whole segment at once.
- **Change Assignee**: Reassign a list of leads to a different salesperson.
- **Update Opt-In Status**: Mass subscribe or unsubscribe contacts.
- **Update Lists**: Move contacts between different Inbox Tabs.

### Advanced Actions
The **Advanced Actions** button provides even more powerful tools for audience management:
- **Bulk Segmenting**: Target contacts based on specific criteria (e.g., all contacts without a specific tag).
- **Triggering Flows**: Manually start a **Message Flow** for a selected group of contacts. This is perfect for manual follow-ups or one-off promotions.

## Important behavior to know
- **Bulk Deletion**: Use the **Delete** button in the bulk toolbar with caution. For WhatsApp Personal accounts, deleting here only removes the record from Luluchat, not from your phone's address book.
