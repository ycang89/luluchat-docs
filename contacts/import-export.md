### Exporting Audience Data
To download your contact list:

## Important behavior to know
- **Phone Number Format**: Always ensure phone numbers include the country code (e.g., 60123456789).
- **Duplicate Handling**: The system will automatically detect existing contacts based on their phone number and update their information rather than creating duplicates.
