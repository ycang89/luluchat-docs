**Processing Time**: Once you submit the import request, the server will process it in the background. You're free to continue using Luluchat while the import runs. Processing usually takes **1 to 15 minutes**, depending on the number of contacts and server readiness. You'll receive a notification once the import is complete.

## Important behavior to know

* **Phone Number Format**: Always ensure phone numbers include the country code (e.g., 60123456789).
* **Duplicate Handling**: The system will automatically detect existing contacts based on their phone number and update their information rather than creating duplicates.
* **Background Processing**: Import requests are processed in the background. You can continue using Luluchat while the import runs. Processing typically takes 1 to 15 minutes depending on the number of contacts and server readiness.
* **Notifications**: You'll receive a notification once your import is complete. Check your notifications to see when the import has finished.
