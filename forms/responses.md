# Forms: Managing Responses

## Viewing Submissions (Step 3)
Once your form is live and customers start submitting data, you can view everything in the **Responses** tab.

### The Responses Table
Each row represents a single submission. You can see:
- **Contact**: The WhatsApp identity of the person who submitted.
- **Verification Status**: Whether they were OTP verified.
- **Answers**: A column for every question in your form.
- **Submitted At**: The date and time of submission.

### Managing Data
- **Search**: Quickly find responses by contact name or specific answers.
- **Export**: (If available) Download your response data for external analysis.

## Best practice 💡
- **Monitor Regularly**: Check your responses frequently to follow up with new leads.
- **Link to Automations**: Use the data collected in forms to trigger specific **Message Flows** for personalized follow-ups.
