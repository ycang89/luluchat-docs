# Forms

## What is the Forms Module?
The Forms module allows you to build custom, no-code web forms to collect information from your customers. The best part is that data is collected directly from the customer's WhatsApp identity, making it easy to link responses to their profile in Luluchat.

## Why use Forms?
- **Lead Generation**: Capture names, emails, and preferences.
- **Surveys & Feedback**: Get direct input from your audience.
- **Seamless Integration**: Link form answers to **Custom Attributes** on the contact's profile.
- **WhatsApp Ready**: Every response is tied to a verified WhatsApp number.
