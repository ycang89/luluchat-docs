# Forms: Building a Form

## How to Build a Form (Step 1)
Building a form in Luluchat is a simple drag-and-drop experience. You can add various elements to collect exactly the data you need.

### Adding Elements
Click the **Build Form** tab to start adding components:
- **Title**: Add a heading and description for your form.
- **Text/TextArea**: For names, open-ended feedback, or short notes.
- **Multiple Choice (Radio/Checkbox/Dropdown)**: For specific options or categorizing leads.
- **Phone Number**: Collect additional contact numbers (automatically guesses country codes).
- **Date & Time**: For booking requests or availability.
- **Media (Image/Video)**: Add visual instructions or promotional content to your form.
- **File Upload**: Allow customers to upload receipts, documents, or photos.

### Mapping to Custom Attributes
For every question, you can link the answer to a **Custom Attribute**. This means as soon as the customer submits the form, their contact profile in Luluchat is updated automatically.

## Best practice 💡
- **Keep it Short**: Only ask for essential information to increase submission rates.
- **Use Clear Labels**: Make sure your questions are easy to understand.
- **Required Fields**: Mark critical fields (like Name or Email) as "Required" to ensure you get the data you need.
