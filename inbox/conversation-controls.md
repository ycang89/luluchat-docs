# Conversation Controls (Pin, Mute, Mark Unread, Archive)

## What are Conversation Controls?
Quick actions to organize and control attention on individual conversations: pin/unpin, mute/unmute, mark as unread, and archive/unarchive.

## When do they trigger?
- Pin/Unpin: when you toggle a conversation to keep it at the top of your view.
- Mute/Unmute: when you silence or restore notifications for a conversation.
- Mark as Unread: when you mark a thread unread to revisit it later.
- Archive/Unarchive: when you move a conversation out of active view or bring it back.

## How to use (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Open the conversation
In `Inbox`, select the conversation you want to control.

### Step 2: Apply the control you need
- Pin/Unpin: click the pin icon to stick/unstick the conversation to the top of your list.
- Mute/Unmute: toggle the mute/bell icon to silence/restore notifications for this thread.
- Mark as Unread: use the unread option to mark it unread (it will show as new in your list).
- Archive/Unarchive: use archive to move it out of active view; unarchive to bring it back.

### Step 3: Confirm the state
Check the icons/list state to ensure the action applied (pinned indicator, muted bell, unread badge, archive move).

## What happens after it triggers?
- Pinned stays at the top of your list until unpinned.
- Muted stops sounds/alerts for that conversation until unmuted.
- Marked as unread shows as unread in the list to remind you to return.
- Archived removes it from active view; unarchiving returns it to the main list.

## Important behavior to know
- These controls are user-specific; they do not affect other teammates’ views.
- Archive does not delete or close the conversation; history is preserved.
- Muting a conversation differs from global sound settings (this is per-conversation).

## Common issues & solutions
- Can’t find the action: check the conversation action bar or overflow menu; UI may differ by role/layout.
- Still getting alerts when muted: refresh and confirm the mute icon; check global sound settings too.
- Pinned not at top: ensure sorting/filtering isn’t overriding pin order.

## Best practice 💡
- Pin priority threads you’re actively working on.
- Use mark-as-unread as a lightweight follow-up reminder.
- Mute noisy low-priority threads without archiving if you still need visibility.
- Archive resolved-but-open threads to keep your active list clean.
