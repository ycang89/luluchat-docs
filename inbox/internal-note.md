## What happens after it triggers?

The note is visible to teammates in the thread but never sent to the contact.

## Important behavior to know

* Notes are internal-only; contacts do not receive them.
* Tag or mention teammates if supported to draw attention.

## Common issues & solutions

* Note sent to customer: ensure the message editor is in `Note` mode before posting.
* Teammate didn’t see it: mention them (if available) and confirm they have access to the conversation.

## Best practice 💡

* Add concise context (what happened, what’s needed) to speed handoffs.
* Use notes before reassigning or closing to keep history clear.
