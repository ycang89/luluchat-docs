## What happens after it triggers?
The note is visible to teammates in the thread but never sent to the contact.

## Important behavior to know
- Notes are internal-only; contacts do not receive them.
- Tag or mention teammates if supported to draw attention.

## Common issues & solutions
- Note sent to customer: ensure the composer is in `Internal Note` mode before posting.
- Teammate didn’t see it: mention them (if available) and confirm they have access to the conversation.

## Best practice 💡
- Add concise context (what happened, what’s needed) to speed handoffs.
- Use notes before reassigning or closing to keep history clear.
