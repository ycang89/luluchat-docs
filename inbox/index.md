# Inbox

## What is Inbox?
The Inbox is where you see and work on all active conversations. From here you can open threads, reply, assign teammates, add tags, and close conversations.

## When does it trigger?
- Whenever a new or existing conversation is routed to your team.
- When you open `Inbox` from the left menu to view and act on conversations.

## How to set it up (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Open Inbox
Click `Inbox` in the left menu to view your conversation lists.

### Step 4: Resolve
When done, close the conversation from the action bar. If it needs follow-up, leave it open and assign or tag accordingly.

## What happens after it triggers?
Your reply is sent immediately. Assignments, tags, and list changes apply to the conversation, and its status updates for everyone on the team.

## Important behavior to know
- Conversations reflect your channel filters and permissions; you may not see threads outside your access.
- Assigning adds the assignee; closing marks the thread as resolved but keeps history intact.
- Tags help segment and search; list moves change where the conversation appears in the inbox.
- Actions are live; changes update for all teammates.

## Common issues & solutions
- Can’t find a thread: adjust filters or confirm channel access.
- Message not sent: check channel connectivity and retry.
- Cannot assign/tag: you may lack permission or the feature may be restricted on this channel.

## Best practice 💡
- Assign or tag as you respond to keep routing clear.
- Use lists (and close) to keep the inbox tidy.
- Add a short closing note before closing a conversation so the contact knows it’s resolved.
