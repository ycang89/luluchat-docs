## What happens after it triggers?
The selected reply is pasted into the composer; sending delivers it to the contact like any normal message.

## Important behavior to know
- Saved replies are shared according to your workspace settings; you may see team-wide or personal replies.
- Always replace placeholders before sending.

## Common issues & solutions
- Can’t find a reply: check if it’s shared to your team or create a new one if allowed.
- Sent with placeholder text: edit before sending; consider standardizing templates.

## Best practice 💡
- Keep replies concise and include one call to action.
- Create variants for common intents (support, billing, onboarding) to reduce edits.
