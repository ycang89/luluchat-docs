# Incognito Mode

## What is Incognito Mode?

Incognito hides your presence in a conversation (e.g., typing/seen indicators) while you review it, without alerting the contact.

## When does it trigger?

* When you switch a conversation to `Incognito` mode in Inbox.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Open the conversation**

In `Inbox`, open the conversation you want to review privately.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Turn off when done**

Switch Incognito off before replying so normal presence indicators resume.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## What happens after it triggers?

Typing/seen signals are suppressed while Incognito is on; once off, normal indicators resume.

## Important behavior to know

* Incognito is session-based; it does not send replies automatically.
* Turning it off restores standard presence behavior.

## Common issues & solutions

* Contact saw typing/seen: ensure Incognito was enabled before interacting.
* Can’t find toggle: check permissions or UI layout for your role.

## Best practice 💡

* Use Incognito when auditing conversations or gathering context before responding.
* Turn it off before sending replies to avoid confusion.
