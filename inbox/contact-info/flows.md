## What happens after it triggers?
The selected flow runs immediately for the contact, sending its configured steps.

## Important behavior to know
- Only published flows appear; respect opt-out status before sending.
- Channel connectivity is required.

## Common issues & solutions
- Flow not listed: ensure it’s published and you have channel access.
- No response: verify channel connection and that the flow has active steps.

## Best practice 💡
- Use concise, goal-focused flows for manual sends.
