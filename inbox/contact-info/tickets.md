## What happens after it triggers?

A ticket is created and linked to the contact; it appears in Tickets views (summary/board/list).

## Important behavior to know

* Requires Tickets access and valid fields.
* Linkage to the contact is automatic from this tab.

## Common issues & solutions

* Cannot create: confirm permissions and required fields.
* Ticket not visible: check board/list filters or status in Tickets.

## Best practice 💡

* Add concise context from the conversation; tag and assign to speed triage.
