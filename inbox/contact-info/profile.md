# Profile (Assignee, Collaborator, Tags, Profile, Custom Attributes, Opt Out)

## What is the Profile tab?
The Profile tab in contact info lets you manage ownership, collaborators, tags, profile details, custom attributes, and opt-out status while viewing the conversation.

## When does it trigger?
- When you edit fields in the Profile tab (assignee, collaborators, tags, display name, remarks, custom attributes, opt-out).

## What happens after it triggers?
Changes apply to the contact and are visible to teammates; ownership, tags, attributes, and opt-out status update instantly and influence routing/automation where applicable.

## Important behavior to know
- Edits are live and may affect automations (e.g., opt-out halts messaging; tags/attributes feed filters).
- Permissions control who can edit ownership, tags, and attributes.

## Common issues & solutions
- Cannot edit a field: check your permissions or whether the field is locked.
- Changes not showing: refresh the contact panel or ensure you saved/applied.

## Best practice 💡
- Set assignee and tags while you work to keep routing and reporting accurate.
- Keep remarks concise; use consistent tag/attribute values for clean filters.
