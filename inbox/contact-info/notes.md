# Notes

## What is the Notes tab?

Lets you add internal-only notes on the contact while in the conversation. Customers do not see these notes.

## When does it trigger?

* When you post an internal note from the `Notes` tab in contact info.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Write and post a note

Enter the note for teammates and post it; it appears in the thread as internal.

{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## What happens after it triggers?

The note is visible to teammates in the conversation but never sent to the contact.

## Important behavior to know

* Internal notes are not delivered to the contact.
* Mentioning teammates (if supported) can notify them.

## Common issues & solutions

* Note visible to contact: ensure you’re in the Notes tab/internal mode before posting.
* Teammate didn’t notice: mention/tag them and verify access.

## Best practice 💡

* Keep notes concise with context and next steps to speed handoffs.
