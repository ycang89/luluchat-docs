## What happens after it triggers?

New message alerts play or stay silent based on your setting; it applies to your session/user.

## Important behavior to know

* Sound preference is user-specific; it does not affect other teammates.
* Some browsers require notification permission for sounds.

## Common issues & solutions

* No sound after unmuting: check browser permissions, system volume, and channel connectivity.
* Still hearing sounds when muted: refresh the page and confirm the icon shows muted.

## Best practice 💡

* Mute during focused work; unmute when actively handling live conversations.
