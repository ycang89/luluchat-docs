# Register a Luluchat Account

## What is Account Registration?
Account registration is the first step to start using Luluchat. You'll create your account using your WhatsApp number, which will be used for authentication and important notifications. After registration, you'll complete a quick onboarding process to set up your team and preferences.

## When to use it?
- **New Users**: If you're signing up for Luluchat for the first time.
- **Team Members**: If you've been invited to join an existing team, you'll still need to register your account first.

{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## What happens after registration?
- **Account Created**: Your Luluchat account is successfully created.
- **Onboarding Started**: You'll be automatically redirected to the onboarding flow to complete your setup.
- **WhatsApp Verification**: Your phone number is verified and linked to your account.

## Important behavior to know
- **WhatsApp Number Required**: You must use a valid WhatsApp number. The OTP will be sent via WhatsApp, not SMS.
- **OTP Expiration**: The OTP code expires after a certain period. If it expires, click "Get OTP" again to receive a new code.
- **One Account Per Number**: Each WhatsApp number can only be registered once. If you've already registered, use the **Login** tab instead.
- **Password Security**: While a 6-character password is accepted, we recommend using 10+ characters for better security.

## Common issues & solutions
- **Didn't receive OTP**:
  - Check that your phone number is correct and includes the country code.
  - Ensure your WhatsApp is active and connected to the internet.
  - Wait a moment and try clicking "Get OTP" again.

- **OTP expired**:
  - Click "Get OTP" again to receive a new verification code.

- **"Phone number already registered"**:
  - This number is already associated with an account. Use the **Login** tab instead, or contact support if you believe this is an error.

- **Password too weak**:
  - Use a longer password (10+ characters) with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols for better security.

## Reset Password

### What is Password Reset?
If you forget your password, you can reset it using the "Forgot Password" on the login page. The system will send a one-time password (OTP) to your registered WhatsApp number to verify your identity before allowing you to set a new password.

### How to Reset Password (Step by Step)

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Access Forgot Password
On the login page, click the **Forgot Password** link below the password field.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Enter Your Registered Phone Number
In the "Forgot Password" modal, enter your **registered WhatsApp number** (the phone number you used when creating your Luluchat account).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: You must use the phone number that was registered during account creation, **not** the connected channel number. The OTP will only be sent to your registered account number.
{% endhint %}

{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important behavior to know**

- **Registered Number Only**: You must use the phone number that was registered when you created your Luluchat account. This is different from any connected channel numbers (WhatsApp Personal or WhatsApp Cloud numbers you've connected to your account).
- **OTP Delivery**: The OTP is sent via WhatsApp to your registered number. If you don't receive it, verify that you're using the correct registered number.
- **No Account Found**: If the phone number you enter is not registered with Luluchat, you will not receive an OTP. Double-check that you're using the number from your account registration.
- **Password Requirements**: Your new password must be at least 6 characters long. For better security, use a longer password with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Password Match**: Both password fields must match exactly. If they don't match, you'll see an error message.
{% endhint %}

### Common issues & solutions
- **Not receiving OTP**:
  - Verify you're using the registered phone number (the one used during account creation), not a connected channel number.
  - Check your WhatsApp messages on the registered number.
  - Ensure your registered number has WhatsApp installed and is active.

- **"Number not registered" error**:
  - The phone number you entered is not associated with any Luluchat account.
  - Double-check the number you used during registration.
  - Contact support if you believe your account exists but the number isn't recognized.

- **OTP expired or invalid**:
  - OTPs have a limited validity period. Request a new OTP if yours has expired.
  - Ensure you're entering the 6-digit code correctly without spaces.

- **Passwords don't match**:
  - Make sure both password fields contain exactly the same password.
  - Check for any extra spaces or characters.

## Best practice 💡
- **Use Your Business WhatsApp Number**: Since this number will be used for important notifications, use a number you check regularly.
- **Save Your Password**: Store your password securely. If you forget it, you can use the "Forgot Password" link on the login page.
- **Remember Your Registered Number**: Keep track of which phone number you used during registration, as this is required for password resets.
- **Complete Onboarding Immediately**: Finish the onboarding process right after registration to start using Luluchat fully.

# Onboarding Process

## What is Onboarding?
Onboarding is a quick setup wizard that helps you configure your Luluchat account after registration. It collects essential information about your company, team size, and preferences to personalize your Luluchat experience. The process takes just a few minutes to complete.

## When does it happen?
- **After Registration**: You'll be automatically redirected to onboarding immediately after successful account registration.
- **Invited Users**: If you've been invited to join a team, you'll see a shorter onboarding flow focused on your company name.

## How to complete onboarding (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Welcome Screen
You'll see a welcome message: "Welcome, [Your Name]! Our mission is to make you more productive. Finish our onboarding flow, this will only take a minute."

  - Sales
  - Founder

Click **Next** to continue.

### Step 6: Billing Information

- **Billing Name** (Required): Your name or the billing contact's name.
- **Billing Email** (Required): Email address for billing notifications.

Click **Submit** to complete onboarding.

## What happens after onboarding?
- **Account Setup Complete**: Your Luluchat account is fully configured.
- **Redirected to Dashboard**: You'll be taken to your Dashboard where you can start using Luluchat.
- **Team Created**: If this is your first account, a team will be created with the company name you provided.
- **Settings Applied**: Your preferences (like 2FA requirement) will be saved and applied to your account.

## Important behavior to know
- **Required Fields**: Company Name, Team Size, "How did you hear about us", Role, and all Billing fields are required. You cannot skip these steps.
- **Optional Fields**: Company Website and 2FA toggle are optional.
- **Billing Information**: This is for notification purposes only. No payment is processed during onboarding.
- **2FA Setting**: If you enable 2FA during onboarding, all future logins will require an OTP code sent to your WhatsApp number.
- **Invited Users**: If you registered via a team invitation link, you'll see a shorter onboarding flow (just company name) before being redirected to the team invitation page.

## Common issues & solutions
- **Can't proceed to next step**:
  - Check that all required fields are filled in the current step.
  - Look for validation error messages below the fields.

- **Website URL validation error**:
  - Make sure your website URL doesn't include the protocol (https:// or http://) in the main field—it's selected separately.
  - Example: Enter "www.example.com" and select "https://" from the dropdown.

- **Billing contact number format**:
  - Include the country code without the "+" sign.
  - Example: For Malaysia (+60), enter "60123333333" (not "+60123333333").

## Best practice 💡
- **Use Accurate Information**: Provide real company details as they may be used for account verification or support.
- **Enable 2FA**: Consider enabling Two-Factor Authentication for better account security, especially if multiple team members will access the account.
- **Complete All Steps**: Don't skip optional fields if they're relevant—they help personalize your Luluchat experience.
- **Save Billing Details**: Even though no charges are made, accurate billing information ensures you receive important account notifications.
