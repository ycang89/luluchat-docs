# Dashboard

## What is the Dashboard?
The Dashboard is the control center of your Luluchat workspace. It provides a quick overview of your account health, message usage, and active contacts, while also offering a step-by-step guide for new users.

## When does it trigger?
The Dashboard is the first page you see after logging in. It remains accessible at any time via the `Dashboard` link in the left-hand menu.

## What happens after it triggers?
The dashboard data refreshes every time you load the page, giving you the most up-to-date view of your team's activity and billing status.

## Important behavior to know
- **Real-time Stats**: Most numbers on the dashboard are updated in near real-time as activities occur across the platform.
- **Top Up Button**: If your message balance is low, you can click the **Top Up** button directly from the balance card (if you have billing permissions).
- **Guided Tours**: You can restart the interactive tutorial at any time by clicking the **Tutorial** button near the top of the page.

## Common issues & solutions
- **Numbers not updating**: Try refreshing the browser page.
- **Top Up button missing**: You may not have administrative or billing permissions. Contact your workspace owner.

## Best practice 💡
- **Daily Check**: Glance at your Message Balance daily to ensure your automations don't stop due to lack of credits.
- **Follow the Lessons**: Don't skip the onboarding steps; they are designed to set up the foundation for a successful automation strategy.
