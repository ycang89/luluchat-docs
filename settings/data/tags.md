**Delete Tag - Permanent Action**

Deleting a tag will permanently remove it from all associated contacts. This action cannot be undone. All contacts who had this tag will lose it immediately.
{% endhint %}

**Important behavior to know**

- **Contact Visibility**: You can see the total number of contacts currently using each tag in the list view.
- **Filtering**: Clicking the contact count for a tag will automatically filter your `Contacts` page to show only those people.
{% endhint %}

## Best practice 💡
- **Standardized Naming**: Use a clear format like `Source: Facebook` or `Status: VIP` to keep your list organized.
- **Color Coding**: Use consistent colors for categories (e.g., green for positive status, red for hot leads).
