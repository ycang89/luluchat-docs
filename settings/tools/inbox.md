#### Configure Media Auto-download

Choose which media types are automatically downloaded when received or sent. This helps save bandwidth and storage.

* Incoming Media: Select Audio, Image, Video, Documents, or Stickers.
* Outgoing Media: Select which types you send that should be auto-processed.

{% step %}
#### Set Conversation Behavior

* Keep assignee after conversation closes: Toggle "Yes" to ensure the same teammate remains owner even after a thread is resolved.
* Show contact number in chat listing: Toggle "Yes" to always display the phone number next to the contact name in your inbox list.

View your current storage usage at the bottom.

{% step %}
#### Manage Storage Space

Use the File Storage table to see which contacts are using the most space.

* Manage: Opens the media library for that specific contact.
* Clear Storage: Permanently deletes all media files for that contact to free up space.

## Important behavior to know

* **Storage Deletion**: "Clear Storage" is permanent. You cannot recover media files once they are deleted from the platform.
* **User Preference**: These settings affect how the inbox behaves for all team members in this workspace.

## Best practice 💡

* **Selective Auto-download**: Disable auto-download for large Video files if you primarily use Luluchat for text and images.
* **Regular Cleanup**: Periodically clear storage for old or inactive contacts to stay within your plan limits.
