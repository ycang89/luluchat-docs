# Broadcast Settings

## What are Broadcast Settings?
Broadcast settings control when and how fast your broadcasts are sent. These settings help you manage your daily message volume and ensure messages are delivered during your preferred hours.

## When does it trigger?
These settings take effect every time you launch a **Broadcast**. The system uses the interval and time windows defined here to regulate the delivery of your messages.

## How to set it up (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Open Broadcast Settings
Go to `Settings` from the left menu, then select `Broadcast` under the **Tools** section.

## What happens after it triggers?
Once saved, all pending or newly started broadcasts will follow the new rules. For example, if you change the end time to earlier, any active broadcast will stop sending sooner than previously planned.

## Important behavior to know
- **Daily Capacity Calculation**: Your total daily message capacity is derived from these three fields. A shorter interval or a longer window increases your daily potential.
- **Off-Hours Queue**: If you launch a broadcast outside of these hours, messages will wait in a queue and start sending automatically at the next **Start Time**.
- **Anti-Spam Protection**: The interval is crucial for protecting your WhatsApp account from being flagged for suspicious activity.

## Common issues & solutions
- **Broadcast stopped sending**: Check if the current time is outside your **End Time**. Sending will resume automatically tomorrow morning.
- **Limit reached message**: If your current settings only allow for 1,000 messages/day and your broadcast has 5,000, it will take 5 days to complete.

## Best practice 💡
- **Align with Audience**: Set your sending window to when your customers are awake and active.
- **Start Slow**: When using a new channel, start with a 1-minute interval and gradually decrease it as your channel reputation grows.
