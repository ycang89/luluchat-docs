# Settings: Broadcast

## What are Broadcast Settings?
Broadcast settings control when and how fast your broadcasts are sent. These settings help you manage your daily message volume and ensure messages are delivered during your preferred hours.

## How to set it up (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Open Broadcast Settings
Go to `Settings` from the left menu, then select `Broadcast` under the **Tools** or **Account Management** section.

### Step 2: Configure Message Interval
Select the **Broadcast Message Interval**. This is the time the system waits between sending messages to each contact (e.g., 30 seconds, 1 minute).

## Important behavior to know
- **Daily Capacity**: Your daily sending limit is automatically calculated based on your interval and sending window. For example, a shorter interval or longer sending window increases the number of messages you can send per day.
- **Off-Hours Queue**: If a broadcast is scheduled or started outside of these hours, the system will queue the messages and begin sending them as soon as the next start time is reached.
- **Interval Purpose**: The interval helps prevent your channel from being flagged for spam by staggering the delivery of messages.

## Common issues & solutions
- **Messages sending too slowly**: Try decreasing the **Broadcast Message Interval** if your provider allows higher frequency.
- **Broadcast stopped sending**: Check if you have reached the **Broadcast End Time** for the day. Sending will resume automatically the next day at the **Broadcast Start Time**.

## Best practice 💡
- **Align with Business Hours**: Set your sending hours to match when your audience is most likely to be active and responsive.
- **Start Conservatively**: Use a longer interval (e.g., 1 minute or more) when starting with a new channel to build reputation before increasing frequency.
