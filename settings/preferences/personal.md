## Important behavior to know
- **2FA Requirement**: Once enabled, 2FA applies to every login attempt for security.
- **Email Updates**: Changing your email will affect where you receive platform notifications.

## Best practice 💡
- **Enable 2FA**: We highly recommend keeping 2FA enabled to protect your account.
- **Strong Passwords**: Use a unique password not shared with other services.
