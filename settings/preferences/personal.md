{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Update Profile Information**

* Full Name: Your display name in the platform.
* Email: Your primary email address for notifications and login.
* Contact Number: Your registered phone number (cannot be changed directly).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Configure Security**

* Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Toggle this on to require an OTP code via WhatsApp when you log in.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Change Password**

Click the Change Password button to update your login credentials. You will need to enter your current password and a new 6-character minimum password.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Important behavior to know

* **2FA Requirement**: Once enabled, 2FA applies to every login attempt for security.
* **Email Updates**: Changing your email will affect where you receive platform notifications.

## Best practice 💡

* **Enable 2FA**: We highly recommend keeping 2FA enabled to protect your account.
* **Strong Passwords**: Use a unique password not shared with other services.
