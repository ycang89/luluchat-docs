## Important behavior to know
- **User Limits**: Your current plan determines how many teammates you can invite.
- **Account Deletion**: If a user deletes their own account, they will appear with an "Account Deleted" tag in this list.

## Best practice 💡
- **Assign Channels**: When editing a user, only give them access to the specific channels they need to manage.
- **Audit Roles**: Regularly review permissions to ensure teammates have the appropriate level of access.
