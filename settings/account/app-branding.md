# Settings: App Branding

## What is App Branding?
Personalize the external-facing pages (e.g., Forms, Booking) with your company's identity.

## How to set it up (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Configure App Namespace
The **App Namespace** is a unique identifier used in your public URLs.
- *Example*: Setting it to `my-shop` changes your form URL to `https://form.luluchat.io/my-shop/form-name`.

### Step 2: Identity Branding
- **Brand Name**: Enter your company's public-facing name.
- **Brand Logo**: Upload your logo. This appears on headers and forms.

### Step 3: Visual Customization
Use the color pickers to match the interface to your brand:
- **Header Background & Text**: Colors for the top navigation bar.
- **Button Background & Text**: Primary colors for call-to-action buttons.

### Step 4: Save
Click `Save` to apply these changes to all your public app pages.

## Important behavior to know
- **Namespace Uniqueness**: Namespaces must be unique across the entire Luluchat platform.
- **Universal Application**: Branding changes apply to all mini-apps (Forms, Bookings, Tickets, etc.) simultaneously.

## Best practice 💡
- **High Contrast**: Ensure your text colors have high contrast against background colors for readability.
- **Transparent Logo**: Use a PNG with a transparent background for the best look on different header colors.
