### Step 3: Delete Account (Danger Zone)
If you need to permanently close your account, use the **Delete Account** section.

## Important behavior to know
- **Subscription vs Account**: Deleting your account does **not** automatically cancel active paid subscriptions. Contact support or your sales rep to cancel billing.
- **Collaborator Impact**: Deleting your account removes your contributions from shared team projects.

## Common issues & solutions
- **Reports seem inaccurate**: If you recently changed working hours, ensure you triggered a "Regenerate Report" action.
